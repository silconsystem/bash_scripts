# found them somewhere, modified some, used 'em wisely
# nice to have, nice to get, nice to share and modify for ur needs
#
# I've put 'em here for safe-keeping, little things dissapear quickly
#

# dont feed them after midnight, keep them away from sunlight
# and whatever you do
# DONT MAKE THEM WET !!!
